## Tips for Good Loops

1. **Choose pre-looped files** - Search for "loop" in the filename
2. **Avoid files with sudden changes** - Consistent sounds loop better
3. **30-120 second duration** - Long enough to sound natural, short enough to load quickly
4. **Normalize volume** - All files should have similar loudness levels
5. **MP3 format** - 128-192kbps is sufficient for ambient sounds

## File Size Guidelines

Keep each file under 2MB for fast loading:
- 30 sec @ 128kbps = ~480KB
- 60 sec @ 128kbps = ~960KB
- 120 sec @ 128kbps = ~1.9MB
